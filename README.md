# Programming-DA-Project
Programming for Data Analysis-Project
•	This repository is for Programming for data analysis.
•	It is a project based on a simulated dataset of a real-world phenomenon.
•	It is in the form a Jupyter Notebook, which demonstrates an investigation of the variables of interest and explores their relationships.
•	The notebook contains Python code only.
•	Software used to make this repository: Anaconda version 3.6.5; Jupyter Notebook version 5.50; Visual Studio Code version 1.28.2
________________________________________
To run the Jupyter Notebook it is recommended that you first download the full Anaconda package from: https://www.anaconda.com/. Alternatively, you can use an NB viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
•	Once you have downloaded Anaconda, the Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows): "jupyter notebook".
•	This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
•	For additional queries about running a notebook please see: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html
